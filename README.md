✅ Notes
✅ No API keys needed — GPT-2 is open and offline.

⚠️ AI output is not medical advice — display this disclaimer clearly.

🧠 GPT-2 is a basic model — for more accurate results, upgrade to clinical models (e.g., medalpaca, mistralai, etc.) later.

📁 Keep your data (.csv) local unless integrating with a backend or database.

🚀 You can easily deploy this to Streamlit Cloud, Docker, or Render.
